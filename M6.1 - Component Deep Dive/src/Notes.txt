********************    NG-content :appButtoncomponent      ********************

THe ng-content div is used for content projection. If there is more than one ng-content, then 
we can use the select="" attribute which selects the class or type of content. It can select 
multiple types like - 
                <ng-content select="input, textarea"></ng-content>
                                    or
                <ng-content select=".icon"></ng-content>

In place of classname, we can also use the other property which will be set by 
    ngProjectAs="icon" in the consumer component. (use - select="icon")


********************    encapsulation : control component    ********************

encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
Disables the scoping of style in a component. Baically makes the Component Styles as Glonal Styles.

********************    Host Element, Host Binding, Host listner :  control component, (:host in dashboard item too)********************

Every component have a host element which is simply the element with component's selector in DOM.
In styles, we can target the host element by using :host property
If we set some component's encapsulation to None, then we can not target the host of that 
component using :host because we have made them global, so they no longer belong to the component
(sort-off). 
Instead of using :host, we can go where it is being used and add the css class(control in this 
case because .control input, .control textarea) to the parent component (app-control).

Instead of doing it repetitively, we can define it in the component selector only.

in crisp, 
1) control component - encapsulation made styles global and added css selector as a class to parent 
conponent via host {} property.
2) dashboard item component - directly apply the css to host.

********************    ElementRef :  control component ********************

It is a part of the angular framework, which defines reference to some element that is rendered
inside the page. We use it to access the host element inside our typescript code from the component
where we use the host.


********************    Dynamic Class binding :  Server Status component ********************
<div [class.status] =  "currentStatus === 'online'", basically if current status is online, then
apply status class to div.


********************    Dynamic Style binding :  Traffic component ********************
[style]="{}"   , Just like class binding, we can also bind style to a div


********************    Enum :  Traffic component ********************
currentStatus : 'online' | 'offline' | 'unknown' = 'online';

above means that csts holds one of the 3 values, we can also make a enum like - 
enum Status {
  Online = 'online',
  Offline = 'offline',
  Unknown = 'unknown'
}
and currentStatus: Status = Status.Online;


********************    @ViewChild and Template Variables :  New Ticket component ********************

Template Variable - a vanilaa JS property, we can add #{name of template variable} lets say #form to a element in the html file.
We will get access to the DOM element in the TS file by - 
@ViewChild('form') private form ?: ElementRef<HTMLFormElement>;           // Html Component
                  or
private btn = viewChild.requied<ElementRef<appButtoncomponent>>('btn');    // self component


********************    @ContentChild and Template Variables :  control component ********************

private control = contentChild.required<ElementRef<HTMLInputElement | HTMLTextAreaElement>>('input');
we have to add the template variable from the code where we are using control component. 


********************    ngfterViewInit and ngAfterContentInit : new ticket and control component ********************

If used @ViewChild , then the value of form will be undefined in ngoninit but defined on ngafterviewinit
But if used viewChild function, then value will be defined in both oninit and afterviweinit.

If used @ContentChild , then the value of form will be undefined in ngoninit but defined on ngafterContentinit
But if used contentChild function, then value will be defined in both oninit and afterContentinit. 

********************    afterender and after next render : control component ********************

These talks about the whole app and not just the component and they are used in a constructor. 
They take a function as input.

********************   @for deep dive : tickets component html ********************

there are other features that we can use like  and they all return true or false
@for (ticket of tickets; track ticket.id){
<li>
    <app-ticket [ticketData]="ticket"  (close)="onCloseTicket(ticket.id)"/> {{$first}} {{$last}} {{$count}} {{$odd}} 
    {{$even}}
</li>
} @empty{
<p>No Tickets available</p>
}

********************  Two way dat binding between components : did notīmplement ********************

can be done by custom input and output decorator.
can be done by model() signal -------more advanced
