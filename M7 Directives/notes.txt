Directives enhances an element
extentsion - .directive.ts

types - 
i) Attribute Directives  - ngModel, do not change the structure of the dom
ii) Structural Directives - ngif, change the structure of the dom, need to use * with it

In modern angular, there are not built in structural directives left.

need to add a standalone directive in the component's import to use it.

We can set alias to input, alias will be th name referred to where component is used.
for ex - queryParam = imput<string>('myapp', {alias: appSafeLink});
myapp is default string, appSafeLink is alias
