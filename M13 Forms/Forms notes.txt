Forms are of two types - 
                            i) Template driven forms(More basic and beginner friendly) 
                            ii) Reactive Forms(More advanced)

Template driven forms are similar to basic html forms, but we apply directives,
to fields of the forms, that lets angular know about the form elements and use the provided 
functionality to intereact with the forms
ngModel directive(without two way binding) also registers the Html elements to angular. For ngModel
to work, the element should have name attribute attached to .because ngmodel use this name to
register element to angular.

### Accessing Template Driven Forms registered by Angulr. - 
FYI - By importing formsModule (essential for using ngModel), angular also registers that we are using
html form element in our html.
We can set template-varible on the form and then this template varible will register to the
Html Form element, but angular allow us template variable to bind to something other 
then html form element by passing a special directive "ngForm" directive provided by the html 
form element. And now the template variable binds to the ngForm objects. which is an object created 
by Angular and our template variable stores this form manager by angular.
Ex - 
<form #form="ngForm" #form2 (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(form, form2)">

### Validating input with validation directives- 
required - this directive can be used with vanilla javascript and browser will add some validaitons
but when used on a element with ngModel directive, this angular takes the charge and shuts off 
browser vlaidations.
Simialar way we can use directives like - email, minlength, pattern etc
But we still can submit empty form because it does not prevent form submissions, rather the 
the values stored in internally managed angular form will now change.
Also, in template driven forms we can get form level info or control (like email pass(registered with ngmodel)) level info as 
per out requirements.
we can directly access controls by setting #email="ngModel" on the element.
